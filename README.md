## Brief

***Diagon Alley Online*** is an e-commerce system filled with magic and fantasy! Inspired by the Diagon Alley in *Harry Potter*, we present a shopping experience infused with magical elements. Users can purchase magical items, wands, broomsticks, and more in this magical world, while administrators, much like the managers of magical stores at Hogwarts, are responsible for managing inventory, handling orders, and other tasks.

Developed with Ruby on Rails, this e-commerce system in a magical world offers a range of functionalities for both users and administrators:

-   **Buyers** can browse and purchase magical items in the magical marketplace, manage their shopping cart and orders, and collect magical items.
-   **Administrators**, like the owners of magical shops, are responsible for managing magical items and processing orders.
