If you expected this exception, use `assert_raises` as near to the code that raises as possible.
Other block based assertions (e.g. `assert_difference`) can be used, as long as `assert_raises` is inside their block.

CommentsControllerTest - test_should_destroy_comment: NoMethodError raised.
If you expected this exception, use `assert_raises` as near to the code that raises as possible.
Other block based assertions (e.g. `assert_difference`) can be used, as long as `assert_raises` is inside their block.

If you expected this exception, use `assert_raises` as near to the code that raises as possible.
Other block based assertions (e.g. `assert_difference`) can be used, as long as `assert_raises` is inside their block.

If you expected this exception, use `assert_raises` as near to the code that raises as possible.
Other block based assertions (e.g. `assert_difference`) can be used, as long as `assert_raises` is inside their block.
